# Heart Disease Prediction

The "Heart Disease Prediction" project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in individuals using machine learning techniques. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn (sklearn), this project provides a comprehensive solution for accurate disease prediction.

## Project Overview

The "Heart Disease Prediction" project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical factors. Early detection of heart disease is crucial for timely intervention and treatment. By employing machine learning algorithms and a curated dataset, this project offers a valuable tool for predicting heart disease.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Processing:** The project involves collecting a dataset containing features related to individuals' health, such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. Using Pandas, the collected data is cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed to ensure it is suitable for analysis. The dataset is included in the repository for easy access.

- **Data Visualization:** The project utilizes data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset. Matplotlib and seaborn are employed to create visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and correlation matrices. These visualizations provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between features and help identify patterns and correlations with heart disease.

- **Train-Test Split:** To evaluate the performance of the classification model, the project employs the train-test split technique. The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets, ensuring that the model is trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on unseen data. This allows for an accurate assessment of the model's predictive capabilities.

- **Classification Models:** The project utilizes various classification models provided by Scikit-learn to predict the presence of heart disease. These models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. Each model brings its own strengths and characteristics to the prediction task, enabling a comprehensive comparison of their performance.

- **Model Evaluation:** The project evaluates the performance of the classification models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the models' ability to correctly predict the presence or absence of heart disease. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices are created to compare the predicted labels against the actual labels.
